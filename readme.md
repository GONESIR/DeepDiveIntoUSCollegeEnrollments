# A Deep Dive Into US College Enrollments and Admissions

The United States is a global leader in post-secondary education providing opportunities for students in diverse backgrounds. Since 1965, affirmative action policies implemented during the Civil Rights Movement aimed to level the playground for minorities and those from underprivileged settings. However, in June 2023 the Supreme Courtâ€™s landmark decision to repeal affirmative action marks a significant turning point in US education policy.


This project aims to visualize the impact of this decision by analyzing data related to college admissions and enrollments across demographic groups.
